# Console-Based-Operating-System
We have opted to design an operating system that is focused on automating multiple tasks with great efficiency and precision. The main objective is to utilize the maximum functionalities of OOP to come up with a suitable solution to reduce the complexity and hectic work of using multiple applications to perform basic tasks.

This project is designed and created by the Zeeshan Ahmed, Aqib Ali and Khalid Khurshid Siddiqui.
All of the features of the project are created by these three members.
This operating system requires modification when it is moved from one computer to another one, By changing the file path of the 
notepad class it will start to work absolutly fine.
The feature of the Recycle bin is still in progress.

we hope you will enjoy, while exploring our project :) .
